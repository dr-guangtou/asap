# Modeling the dark matter halo properties across the M100kpc-M10kpc plane

-------

## Procedures 

### Step 0: 
    - [x] Sample selection, assign redshift, SED fitting.
    - [ ] Extract 1-D i-band surface brightness profiles, convert into surface mass density profiles.
    - [ ] Integrate to get the mass within 10 and 100 kpc.
    - [ ] Make stellar mass cuts, generate the new lens catalog.

### Step 1: 
    - [ ] Precompute the weak lensing signals for everything in the new lens catalog.

### Step 2:

## Data 

The sample of massive galaxies:
    - From `s16a_wide`: (will be made available)
